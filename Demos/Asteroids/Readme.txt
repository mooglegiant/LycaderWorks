The game is Asteroids.  If I really need to explain it to you, then you should be shot :)

This game is not the best. I just wanted to see what I could do over the weekend to see what I can
extract to the helper library.

That being said I know OpenTK is getting an overhaul in the coming weeks for the eventual realse of 1.0!

The physics in the game are not exact.  I've done my best to make the game play like I remember playing it.
Of course, I have not played this game in at least 10 years.
